# Autonomous continuation

Authorized by Seth on 2026-10-22: continue the approved backlog with the same Antigravity tester; remove routine human approval gates. Scope and exceptions are recorded in `STATUS.md` and the spec's execution-policy amendment.

## Operating loop

1. Inspect the next eligible ticket and the delivered baseline; implement only its remaining scope.
2. Record a bounded plan, write meaningful failing regressions and implement; use fake clients/providers for routine acceptance.
3. Freeze the change and send the same Antigravity reviewer a concrete reproduction pack with `expectReply: true`.
4. Resolve findings and request recheck for substantive fixes. A pending review is a handoff, never a silent stop awaiting the user.
5. Once checks and independent review pass, merge, push, close the ticket and update status. Continue to the next eligible ticket without asking for completion sign-off.

## Non-negotiable verification

- Passing tests alone never replace independent different-family review of the actual frozen target.
- Record actual reviewer identity, commands/results, platforms and meaningful limitations. Preserve earlier failed attempts as investigation evidence.
- Native Linux/Omarchy, external provider usage and the working Desktop installation remain outside routine acceptance. Do not claim those passes from fake clients.
- Cancelled/stale results, ownership, secrets, atomic persistence and routing receive explicit review as their tickets land.

## Latest handoff

Published and closed: #1-8, #10-12 and #16. First milestone includes whole-team capacity, durable turn ownership/completion, Stop/corrected restart and visible recovery. Latest #16 source publication08fcee2f78c626f4fccb72f8ed894e44c46f2bf9; issue closed confirmed. Final reviewed target5f45808 includes user-requested hidden managed Windows CLI startup.

Fixture WinError5 scratch race was independently diagnosed and hardened with bounded atomic writer/rechecked. Receipt REVIEW-GEMINI-TICKET-16.md, usage SESSION-CAPACITY.md and CLI-SEATS.md. No live providers/native AI/Omarchy/Desktop changes.

Actual runtime birth integration verifies both true worker PIDs versus venv shims, birth before readiness, hidden CLI console and two retained-handle exits, with zero provider calls.
